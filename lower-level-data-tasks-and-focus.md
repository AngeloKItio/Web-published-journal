#  What are the lower-level tasks with data that take a data scientist's focus off of what matters?


The 21st century saw a significant transformation when data emerged as
the new oil, gaining the recognition it deserved. Companies have now
realized the pivotal role of data in achieving their growth and end-user
goals, as well as in shaping their strategies. Data scientists, often
referred to as "data experts," play a crucial role in harnessing the
power of data to derive valuable insights that drive informed
decision-making and help accomplish business objectives.

However, as **Clive Humby** said: “*Data is the new oil. It's valuable,
but if unrefined it cannot be used. It has to be changed into gas,
plastic, chemicals, etc., to create a valuable entity that drives
profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to
have value*”


Hence, data scientists typically spend around 80% of their time
preparing and managing data for analysis and visualization. Because of
that extensive work on data preparation, data scientists often fall
short of focusing on what really matters for a company which is making
decisions and achieving end goals.

What if in another world, data scientists eliminate those "lower-level
tasks" and concentrate all their energy to understand the company's
domain and deliver actionable results? This will not only be a time
saver but also allow data scientists to optimize their productivity and
increase their values.

Some of those tasks include:



### Data Collection
Data will never be served to you on a silver
platter. A good part of a Data scientist's work is to gather data from
various sources such as databases, web scraping APIs, and spreadsheets.
Although important, data collection is often tedious, and demands a
significant amount of manual effort, detracting experts from some of the
important analytical work.



### Data cleaning
The newly gathered data comes with a raw structure
and needs to be ingested and cleaned appropriately. Data cleaning
involves filling in missing values, removing incomplete records, using
imputation techniques, removing duplicates, and ensuring the correct
standard format for data. Data cleaning is one of the longest,
exhausting, and most routine data science tasks; Data scientists will
hugely benefit from automating the data cleaning process.



### Data Transformation
As data do not always come under the right
format, correcting its original structure will be set to match a target
system's requirements. Some transformation procedures such as
normalization, aggregation, and feature engineering will greatly benefit
data integration and migration. Preprocessing data into usable data
could save time if automated correctly.

### Data Integration and Validation
Merging datasets to combine data
from different sources into a unified dataset while ensuring data
quality by checking for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and
validating assumptions is also a critical part of data preparation and
needs to be done meticulously.

### Data Structuring
After validating your data, it is important to
structure and organize it to ease access and use. Data in tabular forms
and columns are susceptible to gathering more interest from experts and
users.
### Data Security and Compliance
Sensitive data must be hidden from any
unauthorized stakeholder or third-party vendor and this is another
import data readiness step. Safeguarding that information by anonymizing
and applying data redaction techniques to hide or remove confidential
details, protects data and ensures privacy.

### Data Exporting and Deduplication
After data has been thoroughly
prepared, it should be exported for analysis or visualization. It is
important to ensure data deduplication to avoid a storage shortage.

business decisions making.

## If some of the tasks below are automated, what should data scientists focus more on?

### Data visualization and interpretation
Managing to gather clean,
well-processed, and secured data is worth nothing if some visualization
does not follow the trend. Data visualization is a step closer to
bringing the data to life and start getting insights and meaningful
information. This step is often unnoticed as it seems easier than
preparing the data, but it does play a crucial role in showing the
usefulness of the data. Stakeholders are likely to understand great and
well-informed visuals with the cleaned data, compared to a lot of grunt
work done behind the scenes with the raw data. Investing time in
interpreting the data could help businesses grasp the insights to make
clever decisions and boost productivity.

### Model development
Developing Machine Learning Models is usually the
penultimate step of the data scientist when working on a problem. It is
regarded as less time-consuming since most of the work has already been
done and "only" consists of building a model ready for evaluation.
Although it requires less time to be done, model development is a mere
piece of the puzzle and data scientists should put in time to create and
fine-tune a great, powerful, and reusable machine learning model.

### Business decision-making
A person's job is always to make strategic
decisions to help organizations reach their goal and expand their
business; data scientists do not escape the rule. Whereas it is the
easiest technical step, it is also the most important one. Data experts
must then keep that in mind and allocate as much time as they can to it.

### Enhance AI strategies
With AI gaining momentum, organizations must
stay ahead of the curve. Data scientists should adjust their strategies,
investing more time in developing AI models and designing innovative
solutions to boost overall productivity. This could be a golden
opportunity for data scientists to avoid getting bogged down in daily,
repetitive tasks by focusing on long-term AI projects that align with
strategic business objectives.


Automating lower-level tasks allows data scientists to focus on whattruly matters: developing advanced machine learning models, conductingstrategic data analysis, and reaching business goals. By concentrating on these high-impact areas, data scientists can drive meaningful insights and innovation, ultimately delivering greater value to their organizations. Remember, smarter work is more valued than harder work.
